## [Privacy By Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design)

"Privacy by design calls for privacy to be taken into account throughout the whole engineering process. " - [wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design)

Characterised as value sensitive design, originating from human values. 

Historic challenges (since 1995): 
 - Network Infrastructure scaling
 - Priotorizing coporate interests over consumer's ineterests
 - insufficient emphasis on minmizing data collection (sooner made feasible with
[Privacy-enhancing technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies))

### [Privacy-enhancing technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies)


What:
  - Minimizes personal data use
  - Maximise data security
  - Empower Individuals
  - Enforces right to 
[Informational self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_self-determination)

How:
  - use pseudonyms or anonymous data credentials to provide anonymity
  - achieve informed consent about giving personal data to online service providers and merchants

## Privacy By Design From Lecture 

- Proactive not reactive
- Lead with privacy as the default setting
- Embed Privacy into design
- Retain full functionality (positive-sum, not zero-sum)
- Ensure end-2-end security
- Maintain visibility and transparency
- Respect user privacy (user-centric)

In general, privacy is should be business and user centric, hence it need to be planned. 

### Case Smart Meters 

Smart Devices that measures the household consumption of energy (power / heat ) have following requirements: 

Billing integrity
Aggregate statistics availabiltiy 
Fraudulent actions must be detected

Privacy Risks (Class Exercise): 
Sensitive Household information could be leaked / discloud given billing information is required from system requirements
 - Bahvioral patterns can be analysed from leaked information
   This could invouluntary shared with / bought by sellers of housing equipment to target the household.
 - Financial Status of household could be sampled
 - Consumption patterns could be analysed to derive information regarding household attributes (household size, bedtime, dinner time, equipment numbers, type of equipment, effeciency of equipment, age of equipment): These information are senstive to household and could be exploited for manipultation of the customer.
 - Such information should be carefully protected by security measures.
 - Speculation in home invasions / burglers kidnapping children or stealing from elderly people.

### Case Sugar Beats

Danish sugar beet farmers auction: 

Farmers bit on contracts to produce sugar beets (online).

 P2    2     Operator-sided Data Leakage 
 P3    3     Insufficient Data Breach Response 
 P4    New   Consent on Everything

 P10   6     Collection of Data Not Required for the User-Consented Purpose

 ### 3 Pillars of Software Security

- Risk Management ( IT Governance & Threat Ranking)
- Touchpoints ( Code Review, Threat Modeling, Penetration Risk, Risk-based security tests, abuse case, security req., security op.)
- Knowledge (gathering, encapsulating, sharing security knowledge) - Principles - Guidelines - Rules - Vulnerabilities


### Defect, Flaw, Bug

##### Defect
Implementation + Design vuln.
Dormant

##### Flaw
- DESIGN ISSUE
Problem at deeper level usually design

##### Bug
- CODE ISSUE
Implementation level


### Exercise: Think about Flaws

Five Flaws 
- web application vulnerabilities
  3rd party open source dev tools (npm, PyPI)

### Verizon Breach Report 2019

Trending 26% stolen records and 40% stolen records. 
Why? 
Small security budget -> poor security. 


Today:
Security is currently being more priotorized. 
Types of initiatives: 
- Network Perimeter (firewalls)
- Enterprise Security (blocking malware and not allowing admin rights for most users)
- physical security(badgning in and out of secure areas)

###### But we still face issues in the software stack. 

BIOS vs. UEFI Boot 

UEFI has been configured to control malware infection by checksum in the boot process.


### [Exploit-Db](https://www.exploit-db.com)

üî∫Understand the risk of poorly trained developers in security!

Code is being exploited in many different ways. 

üî∫C is fast but not secure compared to other programming language. 

‚úîÔ∏è Java - Secure - Scripting since JVM is a software program that runs the Java code makes it more secure.

Govern is important for software security - NIS2 -.

### Attack Vectors

1. Login username and password combination.

   - Software is build for OSINT combination for input about victim, animals, dates, names, children... to guess passwords

3. Webserver vulnerabilties / not patched
   - [exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com)
5. Database vulnerabitlities / not patched
6. OS system vulnerabilities / not patched
7. Third-party components ...
8.  List goes on

- System security only as strong as the weakest link.

### Privacy By Design

Schroeder Economy of mechanisms

Auguste Kerckhoff's principle

- "Security of a system should not depend on the secrecy of its protection mechanisms"

#### 1.  Least Common Mechanism / Compartmentalisation

- Limit shared resources to a minimum.
- Isolated groups with limited and controlled means of information exchange.


#### 2. Minimum Exposure 
- Reduce external interfaces to a minimum
- Limit the amount of information given away
- Minimize the window of opportunity for an adversary, e.g. limiting time for availability of attack
    
- Hijack private email is easy
- Session hijacking / Session Copying of credentials stored in the browser ( library browsers are vulnerable )
- Risk Acceptance -> we cannot prevent users from acceptable usage and avoid users from ease of use since this will be tempting to circumvent in an "unsecure" unacceptable way. 


#### 3. Least Privilege

- Singleton connections for Database connection.


#### 4. Minimum Trust 

- Zero Trust


#### 5. Secure, Fail-Safe Defaults

- failing securely


#### 6. Complete Mediation

- Defence in Depth
- Monitored and Controlled Access to resources
- Check Priviledges for every access
- One way paths

Example: 
[Fort Knox
](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Knox_(gulddepot))

#### [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) - Mandatory Access Control

#### 7. No Single Point of Failure

- Seperation of Privileges


#### 8. Usability

- Psychological acceptability

#### 9. Promoting Privacy

- Consider all aspects of users' data in context
